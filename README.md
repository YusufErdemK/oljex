## How It Works

Oljex OS is built using Electron, which allows for the creation of desktop applications using web technologies. The core of Oljex is a terminal emulator that interprets user commands and interacts with a virtual filesystem implemented in JavaScript. The terminal interface is styled with CSS to provide a retro TTY look and feel. Commands are parsed and executed within the Electron environment, allowing for a seamless user experience.
